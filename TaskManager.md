Task: Fix Vercel Build Configuration
End Time: 2025-01-16 20:52
Summary: Removed custom installCommand and updated buildCommand to use pnpm instead of npm. Removed fake environment variables from buildCommand as they're no longer needed with lazy initialization. Vercel will now auto-detect pnpm from pnpm-lock.yaml and use it correctly.
Issues: None
