Summary: Fixed the Ollama Cloud API endpoint from incorrect "https://api.ollama.ai" to correct "https://ollama.com". The API was failing because it was using the wrong base URL. Updated lib/api-config.ts with the correct endpoint. The chatbot should now connect properly to Ollama Cloud with automatic fallback to self-hosted VPS at http://168.231.78.113:11434.
Issues: None
