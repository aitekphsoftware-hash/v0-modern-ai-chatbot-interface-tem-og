Task: Debug EMILIOAI API Key Error
Start Time: 2025-01-16 20:45
Description: User reports "Emilio api key error" when trying to use the chat. Need to add comprehensive debugging to understand why the API is failing. The environment variables are set correctly, so the issue is likely with the API response or authentication.
Prep: Check environment variables (confirmed EMILIOAI_API_KEY is set), read API config and chat route to understand the flow.
