Summary: Added comprehensive API key format validation (must be xxx.xxx format with 8+ chars per part), enhanced error messages with specific feedback for authentication failures, created test connection endpoint at /api/test-connection for debugging, improved logging with clear visual indicators and actionable error messages. The system now validates the API key before sending requests and provides clear feedback about what's wrong.
Issues: None
